aws-infrastructure-management
This repository showcases my approach to managing AWS infrastructure using Terraform, following best practices in cloud infrastructure as code (IaC). The project demonstrates:

Modular Design: Each component of the infrastructure, such as EC2 instances and S3 buckets, is encapsulated in reusable Terraform modules, promoting maintainability and scalability.
CI/CD Automation: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are implemented using GitHub Actions, allowing for automatic application of Terraform changes to AWS environments.
Secure State Management: Terraform state is securely stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, with state locking enabled via DynamoDB to ensure consistency and prevent concurrent modifications.
Project Overview
This project is structured to manage AWS resources efficiently by splitting infrastructure into multiple modules. It uses a modular approach that allows for easy scaling and adaptability across different environments, such as development, staging, and production.

Key Features:
AWS EC2 Instance Management:
EC2 instances are managed through a dedicated module that supports the creation of multiple instances with customizable settings such as AMI, instance type, and tags.

S3 Bucket Management:
A separate module manages S3 buckets, with support for setting access controls (ACLs) and tags. Each environment can provision its own bucket with specific settings.

Environment Separation:
The project supports multiple environments (e.g., dev, prod), each with its own configuration, variables, and state file stored in S3.

Backend Configuration:
The state file is stored in an S3 bucket, and DynamoDB is used for state locking to ensure that only one process can modify the state at a time, preventing issues like race conditions.

Automation via CI/CD:
Terraform plans and applies are automatically triggered through GitHub Actions whenever changes are pushed to the repository. The pipeline includes:

Code checkout.
Initialization of Terraform.
Terraform Plan and Apply commands.
State management and locking using S3 and DynamoDB.
Variables and Flexibility:
Variables are used to make the infrastructure more dynamic, supporting different environments and customization without modifying the core code. These variables are defined globally and within each module, providing flexibility for various configurations.
